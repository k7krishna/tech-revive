Let's refresh some basics on handling exceptions in JAVA-

✅ Catch with Precision
- Catch specific exceptions rather than generic ones like Exception.
- This allows you to handle each exception type differently and provide tailored solutions.

try {
 // Code that may throw specific exceptions
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
 // Handle file not found exception
} catch (IOException e) {
 // Handle IO exception
}


✅ Graceful Error Handling
- When an exception strikes, don't leave your users in the dark!
- Provide meaningful error messages or logs to facilitate troubleshooting and enhance the user experience.

try {
 // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
 logger.error("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
 // Provide meaningful error message to aid in troubleshooting
}


✅ Resource Cleanup with Finesse
- Use the 'finally' block only to release system resources like file handles, database connections, or network connections. 

try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
 // Code
} catch (IOException e) {
 // Handle exception 
} finally {
 // Cleanup: The file input stream will be closed automatically
}


✅ Rethrow Strategically
- Consider whether to re-throw an exception or wrap it in a new one. 
- Rethrowing can be useful for propagating errors, but remember to provide valuable context for smooth debugging.

try {
 // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (IOException e) {
 logger.error("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
 throw new CustomException("An error occurred while processing the data.", e);
 // Rethrow the exception while providing additional context
}


✅ Mindful Checked Exceptions
- Choose checked exceptions wisely. Excessive use can clutter code and make it harder to maintain.
- Opt for unchecked exceptions or custom types when they fit the bill.

public void readFile() throws IOException {
 // Code that may throw IOException
}


✅ Embrace the Power of 'try-with-resources':
- For automatic resource management, leverage the elegance of the try-with-resources statement.
- It ensures proper resource closure and minimizes leaks.

try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
 Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
 // Code that uses the connection and statement
} catch (SQLException e) {
 // Handle any exceptions that occur
}


✅ Ignoring is Not an Option
- Avoid turning a blind eye to exceptions!
